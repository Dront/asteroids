![Awesome logo (not mine)](http://orig01.deviantart.net/dcc2/f/2011/115/c/e/asteroid_text_by_xdrac-d3eu89g.png)

Simple point-and-click game.
Trying out cocos2d and pyglet just for fun.

## TODO:
- Implement collisions with collision_model
- Needs moar asteroids!
- Create bullets and stuff
- Enemy class with basic parameters
- Create GameOver scene and HUD
- Get nicer font. Current font really sucks here :(
- App icon is not changing :(
